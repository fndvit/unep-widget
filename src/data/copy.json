Right now, we are heading for a catastrophic temperature rise in excess of 3°C this century. To limit global warming to 1.5°C, we need to cut emissions from greenhouse gases —heat-trapping gases that include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, nitrous oxide and others— by 30 gigatones annually by 2030. That means cutting emissions from transport and industry, managing land and resources more efficiently, building smart cities and curbing deforestation and food waste.",
